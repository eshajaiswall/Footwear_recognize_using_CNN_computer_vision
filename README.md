# Footwear_recognize_using_CNN_computer_vision
**Summary**
This project aimed to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of accurately recognizing different types of footwear from images. Leveraging the power of deep learning, the model was trained on a diverse dataset of footwear images, which included various categories such as shoes, boots, sandals with high accuracy.

**Model Training:-**
The model training process involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the data to improve model robustness.

Model Architecture: Building a CNN with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

Training: Training the model using the preprocessed data and saving the best model based on validation performance.

**Conclusion:-**
The CNN model demonstrates strong performance in recognizing different types of footwear, showcasing the effectiveness of deep learning in image classification tasks. The model can be further improved by incorporating more data, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and experimenting with advanced CNN architectures.
